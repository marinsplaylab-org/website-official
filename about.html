      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Marins PlayLab is an independent space for exploring STEM and more through interactive open projects, visuals, experiments, and discoveries.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a small passion project and it is still in an early phase. The goal is simple: make learning clear and fun. You will find short educational posts, science updates, visual explanations, and small projects you can try yourself. This includes simulations that help you explore ideas, not just read about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributions are welcome. Some parts of the workflow use AI to speed things up, but everything is reviewed so posts and projects stay as accurate and reliable as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to grow this space and its community. Over time, more topics will be added as the project grows.
      </p>
      <h2>Open Source and Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        The website and its projects are published on
        <a href="https://github.com/marinsplaylab-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
        so that everyone can learn from them, reuse them, and improve them. Updates will arrive gradually as the site grows.
