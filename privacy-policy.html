        No ads. No popups. No aggressive tracking. We try to use only essential services to run the site and projects.

      <p>
        This site does not require accounts and we do not sell or share personal data for marketing.
        If you contact us by email, we use your message to respond and keep it only as needed for support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our hosting provider may collect standard server logs (such as IP address, user agent, and timestamps)
        for security and reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use Cloudflare as a reverse proxy and CDN to improve performance and protect the site.
        Cloudflare may process IP addresses and request metadata for security and caching.
        Their privacy policy applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not use advertising cookies. If any third party service sets cookies, their policies apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want us to delete an email you sent, you can contact us and we will do our best to comply.

        This policy may be updated as the project grows. The date above reflects the latest update.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a third party service is involved, their policies apply and they handle their own data.
